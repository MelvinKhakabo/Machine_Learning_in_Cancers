**Summary**

Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers globally, with 2.2 million new cases annually and a 75% five-year mortality rate. The complexity of cancer cells and their resistance to treatments pose significant challenges to clinical management of the disease. Over the past decades, technological advances have generated extensive clinical, imaging, and sequencing databases, which have enhanced cancer research. However, analyzing these vast datasets requires significant expertise, even with dimensionality reduction techniques. Machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) offers a solution by automating the identification of patterns within high-dimensional data, assisting in clinical management and prognosis.

ML and DL are branches of artificial intelligence (AI) that specializes in predicting outcomes by recognizing patterns within data through the use of mathematical algorithms. ML has shown promise in early detection of lung cancer, particularly through computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. DL-based CAD systems automatically extract intrinsic nodule features, model 3D shapes, and improve lung cancer diagnosis by integrating computer vision models for feature characterization and classification. This hybrid system shows potential to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. However, the limited availability of labeled images remains a prevailing challenge, often leading to overfitting.

ML is also applied to omics data (including genomics and proteomics) for cancer type classification and early detection. Techniques like liquid biopsies and sequencing enable the identification of genetic mutations relating to oncogenesis. ML models use omics data to detect tumors and classify lung cancer subtypes. These recognized driver mutations typically impact gene expression and signaling processes; enabling accurate categorization of malignancies and lung cancer subtypes.

In treatment and prognosis, ML models have improved cancer treatment response evaluation and therapy optimization. Metrics tracking tumor growth or shrinkage via imaging data have been used alongside computer vision models to predict treatment response and drug efficacy. Other ML models utilizing gene expression and sequencing data enhance survival prediction, distinguishing high- and low-risk patients. In immunotherapy, ML also predicts responses by analyzing immune microenvironments, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and neoantigens. Specifically, neoantigen prediction models assess peptide-HLA binding affinity, aiding the development of personalized immunotherapies.

Despite the widespread use of ML in lung cancer research, challenges remain. Integrating imaging, omics, and clinical data provides a comprehensive view but faces challenges from data noise, dimensionality problems, and platform variability. Model robustness and generalizability are also crucial concerns. Also, metrics like accuracy often fail to reflect true clinical needs. Although ML and DL models hold promise for lung cancer diagnosis and management, further research is needed to refine them for real-world clinical applications.
